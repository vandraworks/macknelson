# The site blueprint must have a title, the title may be different from the file name
# The `site.yml` blueprint defines the look of the start page (Dashboard) of the Panel.
title: Schell Games

# The site blueprint usually provides easy access to all main pages of the site.
# In this example blueprint, we also show subpages of the `photography` and `notes` pages.
# More about the site blueprint: https://getkirby.com/docs/reference/panel/blueprints/site

columns:
  - width: 3/4
    sections:
      # The `notes` section reuses the pages section defined in `/site/blueprints/sections/blog.yml`
      pages:
        type: pages
        create: default
        templates:
          - home
          - about
          - default

        # The `pages` pages section shows other main pages of the site
        # Using the `templates` option, we limit which types of pages are shown
        # Using the `create` option, we limit the type of page that can be created when a new page is created
        # Note that the `sandbox` page and the `error` page that also exist in the content folder but use different blueprints thus do not show up in the list
        # Since the error page's blueprint is set to `read: false`, it wouldn't show up here even if you added the error blueprint to the templates list
  # The second column has two sections, `notes` and `pages`
